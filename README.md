TOPICS TO COVER : 

1 JS BASICS 


2 PROPERTIES OF JS : 
i) Interpreted
JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning it's executed line-by-line at runtime by the JavaScript engine in the browser or server environment, 
rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand

BENIFITS : THERE WILL BE LESS ONE STEP 

DEMERITS : 
a) Performance Overhead
b) More prone to runtime errors

ii) Dynamically Typed
 Variables in JavaScript are not bound to a specific data type. Types are determined at runtime and can change as the program executes

 iii) Single threaded thread sinle execution of a lang 
JavaScript executes code in a single-threaded environment, meaning it processes one task at a time. We will dive deeper into this next week.

iv) Garbage collected (auto memory allocation and deallocation)
JavaScript automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation through garbage collection, 
which helps prevent memory leaks by automatically reclaiming memory used by objects no longer in use.
